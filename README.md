# How to run:
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the root directory
- Place the .env file containing the project secrets in the root directory(note: You'll also need the Redis secrets I added, email me at mihail.s.mk@gmail.com)
- ```npm start``` (you may need to use ```npm install``` before)

That's it! The webapp can be found at localhost:3000
