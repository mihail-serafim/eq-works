# How to run:
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the root directory
- Place the .env file containing the project secrets in the root directory(note: You'll also need the Redis secrets I added, email me at mihail.s.mk@gmail.com
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev``` will start the app (NOT ```npm start```) 

That's it! The webapp can be found at localhost:3000
